## Best Practices

1. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Use Hero Section at the top for impact
   - Alternate between light and colored backgrounds
   - End with a strong CTA Block

2. **Content Flow**
   - Introduction → Details → Benefits → Action
   - Mix text-heavy and visual sections
   - Space out CTA blocks (don't use too many)

3. **Mobile Considerations**
   - All templates are responsive
   - Stats and features automatically stack on mobile
   - Hero sections maintain impact on small screens

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize images before uploading
   - Use appropriate image sizes
   - Consider lazy loading for images

5. **Accessibility**
   - Maintain color contrast
   - Use descriptive alt text for images
   - Keep text readable (18px+ for body)
   - Ensure buttons have clear labels
