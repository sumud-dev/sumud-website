# Page Builder User Guide

This guide is designed for content editors and non-technical users to learn how to manage website content using the Sumud Page Builder.

## 1. Introduction

The Page Builder is a visual tool that allows you to create and update pages on the Sumud website without needing to write code. You can easily add sections (blocks), edit text, upload images, and manage translations for both English and Finnish versions of the site.

## 2. Accessing the Page Builder

1.  Log in to the **Admin Dashboard**.
2.  Navigate to the **Page Builder** section in the admin menu.
3.  You will see a list of all existing pages.

## 3. Managing Pages

### Creating a New Page
1.  Click the **+ New Page** button at the top right of the Page Builder list.
2.  You will be taken to a blank page editor.
3.  Fill in the **Page Title** and **Slug** (the URL path, e.g., `about-us`).

### Editing an Existing Page
1.  Find the page you want to edit in the list.
2.  Click the **Edit** (pencil icon) button next to the page name.

### Duplicating a Page
If you want to create a similar page to an existing one:
1.  Find the page in the list.
2.  Click the **Duplicate** (copy icon) button.
3.  A copy will be created with `(Copy)` in the title. You can then edit it to fit your needs.

### Deleting a Page
1.  Click the **Delete** (trash icon) button next to the page.
2.  Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog. **Warning: This action cannot be undone.**

## 4. The Page Editor Interface

The editor is divided into two main areas: **Page Settings** and **Content Blocks**.

### Page Settings (Top Section)
*   **Page Title**: The internal name of the page.
*   **URL Slug**: The web address for the page (e.g., `our-mission`).
*   **Language Switcher**: Toggle between **English (EN)** and **Finnish (FI)** to edit content for each language.
*   **Status**: Set the page to **Draft** (hidden from public) or **Published** (visible to everyone).
*   **Save Changes**: Always remember to click the **Save Changes** button at the top right after making edits.

### Content Blocks (Main Section)
The content of your page is built using "Blocks". Each block represents a section of the page, such as a header, a text paragraph, an image, or a quote.

#### Adding a Block
1.  Look for the list of available blocks at the top of the content area (e.g., *Hero, Text, Image, Quote, etc.*).
2.  Click on a block type button (e.g., **+ Text**) to add it to the bottom of your page.

#### Editing a Block
1.  Locate the block you want to edit.
2.  Fill in the fields provided (e.g., Title, Description, Button Text).
3.  For some blocks, you may see tabs for **Content** and **Settings**.
4.  **Images**: If a block has an image, you can paste the image URL or upload one (if supported).

#### Reordering Blocks
1.  Click and hold the **Handle** (six dots icon) on the left side of a block.
2.  Drag the block up or down to the desired position.
3.  Release the mouse button to drop it.
4.  Alternatively, use the **Up** and **Down** arrow buttons on the left of each block.

#### Deleting a Block
1.  Click the **Trash** icon within the block you want to remove.
2.  The block will be immediately removed from the editor.

## 5. Working with Languages

The Page Builder supports multi-language content (English and Finnish).

1.  **Select Language**: Use the language dropdown in the Page Settings to check which language you are currently editing.
2.  **Separate Content**: Most text fields are separate for each language. For example, changing the "Title" while in *English* mode will **not** change the "Title" in *Finnish* mode.
3.  **Applies to All**: Structure changes (like adding or reordering blocks) usually apply to both languages. You only need to translate the text inside the blocks.

## 6. Block Types Reference

Here are some common blocks you might use:

*   **Hero**: Large top section with a title, subtitle, and background image.
*   **Text**: Simple paragraph text.
*   **Heading**: Section titles (H1, H2, H3).
*   **Image**: A standalone image with an optional caption.
*   **Quote**: A highlighted quote with an author name.
*   **Stats**: A row of statistics (e.g., "100+ Members").
*   **Campaigns Grid**: Automatically displays a list of active campaigns.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: A prominent box encouraging users to click a button.
*   **Video**: Embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo.
*   **Accordion**: Collapsible text sections, great for FAQs.

## 7. Special Pages (UI Translations Mode)

Some complex pages (like *Articles, Events, Campaigns*) are managed differently.

*   When you open these pages, you might see a "UI Translations Mode" message.
*   Instead of blocks, you will see a specialized form to edit specific labels and text for that page type.
*   Just fill in the fields for each language as usual.

## 8. Publishing Your Changes

1.  Make sure you have entered content for **both** English and Finnish (if applicable).
2.  Set the **Status** dropdown to **Published**.
3.  Click **Save Changes**.
4.  Visit your website to verify the page looks correct.
