# Notes:
# - The Netlify Next.js plugin will handle SSR and Edge Functions for supported Next.js features.
# - If your site needs environment variables (e.g., Supabase keys, Cloudinary), add them in the Netlify UI.
# - If you prefer to pin a different plugin version, add it in `package.json` devDependencies.
