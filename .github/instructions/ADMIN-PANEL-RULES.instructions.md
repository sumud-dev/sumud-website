# ADMIN-PANEL-RULES.md

This file defines strict conventions and architecture rules for this project. It must be followed by all contributors and AI copilots to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and professionalism.

- **AI Copilots (MUST):** Ensure consistency with the rest of the codebase and introduce only minimal changes without regression.
I want to go one by one, review the following code: ensure that it's empty of duplicating, coupling. it should follow composability, dry, decoupling and clean, sop. the business logic should be separated from the db and actions. don't over-engineering and add unnecessary files.
Ensure the performance optimizations. please show only the parts I need to change with line number and don't generate all the code or try to save the usage. use the state management. Ensure consistency with the rest of the codebase and introduce only minimal changes.

## Naming Conventions

### Component Files

- Use PascalCase for full components:
  - Examples: `CampaignForm.tsx`, `UsersTable.tsx`, `NewsCard.tsx`
- File names must match the feature and purpose.
- Names should be short, precise, and meaningful.
- Avoid generic names like: `Wrapper.tsx`, `Component.tsx`, `Index.tsx`, `Thing.tsx`

### Primitives

- Use lowercase filenames for atomic, reusable components:
  - Examples: `input.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `checkbox.tsx`
- Save all primitives inside `/components/primitives/`

---

## Folder Structure and Responsibilities

Use folders that reflect the purpose of the components, not just the route or page.

/components/
├── campaigns/ → Only campaign-specific logic and UI
├── news/ → News-specific components
├── forms/ → Only full form components (e.g., CampaignForm.tsx)
├── tables/ → Only table-related components (e.g., UsersTable.tsx)
├── primitives/ → Pure UI building blocks (e.g., input.tsx, button.tsx)
├── ui/ → Shared UI blocks (e.g., modal.tsx, card.tsx)
├── composables/ → Shared hooks or logic (e.g., useSearch.ts, usePagination.ts)
├── layout/ → Layout-level components (e.g., AdminLayout.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)


- Do not place logic or utilities in the wrong folders.
- Place feature-specific components in their own folders like `campaigns/`, `news/`.
- Do not place primitives inside `forms/`, `tables/`, or other unrelated folders.

---

## Prohibited Patterns

- Do not use `index.ts` or `index.js` files for central exports.
  - All imports must be explicit and clear.
- Do not name files ambiguously.
  - Avoid names like `Component.tsx`, `Thing.tsx`, `Wrapper.tsx`, `Page.tsx`
- Do not use names like `SearchFilter.tsx`
  - It must be either `Search.tsx` or `Filter.tsx` — never both in one.

---

## Code Organization and Quality

- Follow SOC: Separate logic by concern — UI, data, hooks, handlers, etc.
- Follow DRY: Abstract repeated logic or UI responsibly.
- Keep files focused and purpose-driven.

---

## File Size and Structure

- No single file should exceed 500 lines of code.
  - If it does, break it into smaller subcomponents or hooks.
- Each file should have:
  - A single, clear responsibility
  - Proper formatting, comments, and structure
  - No dead code

---

## API Namespace Conventions

- Admin-specific APIs should be under `/dashboard/`, not `/api/`:
  - Correct: `/dashboard/pages/{slug}`
  - Incorrect: `/api/pages/{slug}`

---

## Component Builder Guidelines

- Reusable elements (such as `SearchBar`, `Table`, `Modal`) must:
  - Be configurable via props
  - Be visually compact and optimized for user experience
  - Use icon and short label dropdowns when listing options
- All inserted elements should:
  - Conform to the builder's structure
  - Be previewable and vertically added
  - Use a consistent data shape and rendering structure

---

## Developer Communication

- If code is starting to go out of scope, alert immediately.
- When facing architectural trade-offs:
  - Compare three top professional practices
  - Choose the most maintainable option and explain why

## First-Time Contributor Quick Checklist

- Is your file in the right folder?
- Does your filename follow the convention?
- Is your file under 500 lines?
- Are you using explicit imports (no index files)?
- Is your component single-responsibility?
- Is your logic DRY and reusable?
